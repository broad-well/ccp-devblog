        <p>Welcome. Our Collaborative Creative Project will address some of three themes:
            Community/Isolation, Grind, and Futurity. In this development blog, we will
            document our process of creating and demonstrating an idea that addresses these themes.</p>

        <p>We are moving forward with the idea of a Second-Person Dating study,
            where we put pairs of participants on a mediated date where each participant
            wears a VR headset showing their partner's perspective. This idea underscores our
            common pandemic experience of seeing ourselves on camera in online video conferences
            and extrapolates it to the romantic realm. It also comments on the potential of
            connection and intimacy between partners without seeing each other, subverting
            normative expectations.</p>
